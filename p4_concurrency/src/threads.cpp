  /*NOTE: On Thread Declaration (below)
  * std::thread t(Vehicle());
  * 
  * 1. a variable definition for variable t of class std::thread,
  * initialized with an anonymous instance of class Vehicle, or
  * 
  * 2. a function declaration for a function t that returns an object of
  * type std::thread and has a single (unnamed) parameter that is a pointer
  * to function returning an object of type Vehicle.
  * 
  * Most programmers would presumable expect the first case to be true, but
  * the C++ standard requires it to be interpreted as the second - hence the
  * compiler error.
  * 
  * There are three ways of forcing the compiler to consider the line as the
  * first case, which would create the thread object we want:
  * 
  * std::thread t1( (Vehicle()) );             // Add extra pair of parantheses
  * std::thread t2 = std::thread( Vehicle() ); // Use copy initialization
  * std::thread t3{ Vehicle() };               // Use uniform initialization with braces
  */

  /* VARIADIC TEMPLATES AND MEMBER FUNCTIONS:
  * he thread constructor may be called with a function and all its
  * arguments. That is possible because the thread constructor is a
  * "variadic template" that takes multiple arguments.
  *
  * There is one more difference between calling a function directly and
  * passing it to a thread: With the former, arguments may be passed by
  * value, by reference or by using move semantics - depending on the
  * signature of the function. When calling a function using a variadic
  * template, the arguments are by default either moved or copied -
  * depending on wether they are rvalues or lvalues.
  * 
  * In the following example, two threads are started, each with a different
  * string as a parameter. With t1, the string name1 is copied by value, 
  * which allows us to print name1 even after join has been called. The
  * second string name2 is passed to the thread function using move
  * semantics, which means that it is not available any more after join has
  * been called on t2.

  /* EXAMPLE 2: std::ref() 
  * When passing the string variable name to the thread function, we need
  * to explicitly mark it as a reference, so the compiler will treat it as
  * such. This can be done by using the std::ref() function

  /* EXAMPLE 3: calling object member function within a thread
  * In the example above, the Vehicle object v1 is passed to the thread
  * function by value, thus a copy is made which does not affect the
  * "originalâ€œ living in the main thread. Changes to its member variable
  * _id will thus not show when printing calling printID() later in main.
  * The second Vehicle object v2 is instead passed by reference. Therefore,
  * changes to its _id variable will also be visible in the main thread.

  * outlives the completion of the thread t2 - otherwise there will be an
  * attempt to access an invalidated memory address. An alternative is to
  * use a heap-allocated object and a reference-counted pointer such as
  * std::shared_ptr<Vehicle> to ensure that the object lives as long as it
  * takes the thread to finish its work.

  /* RUNNING MULTIPLE THEADS AT ONCE:
  * A number of threads is created and added to a vector. The basic idea is
  * to loop over the vector at the end of the main function and call join
  * on all the thread objects inside the vector.
  * 
  * Note the use of push_back() causes a compiler error. The problem is that
  * by pushing the thread object into the vector, we attempt to make a copy
  * of it. However, thread objects do not have a copy constructor and thus
  * cannot be duplicated.
  * 
  * To solve the problem, we can use the function emplace_back() instead of
  * push_back(), which internally uses move semantics to move our thread
  * object into the vector without making a copy.
